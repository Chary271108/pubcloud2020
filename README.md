# Networking in Public Cloud Deployments 2020

This is a repository for my solutions to hands-on assignments (exercises)
of the
[Networking in Public Cloud Deployments](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/)
course during spring of 2020.

This repository fulfills a dual purpose:

1. To submit solutions to the course exercises.
2. As a reference for me (and potentially others).

My solutions may be longer than strictly necessary.
I want to really understand what happens,
and I want to create a reference for me.
This probably takes more time than just hacking togther a solution,
but it results in a better learning experience for me.
Additionally, I take notes while working on the assignments,
instead of creating a report after the fact.
I even keep mistakes in the report,
as long as I think they can be a useful reference.
