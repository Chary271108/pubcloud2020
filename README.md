# Networking in Public Cloud Deployments 2020

This is a repository for my solutions to hands-on assignments (exercises)
of the
[Networking in Public Cloud Deployments](https://www.ipspace.net/PubCloud/)
course during spring of 2020.

This repository fulfills a dual purpose:

1. To submit solutions to the course exercises.
2. As a reference for me (and potentially others).

## Links to the Exercise Solutions

1. [Define the Requirements](ex1-reqs/) - ruminations on cloud use
2. [Simple Infrastructure-as-Code Setup](ex2-iac/) - looking at AWS,
   AWS CloudFormation, and Terraform
